### Description
#### This is my take on the final project for the Odin Project Foundations course. Every single line of code and CSS was done by me. 

### Features
* The calculator is fully interactive with both keyboard and mouse.
* Hover effect with mouse, the same effect applied on keydown via keyboard
* Scaling of buttons both via keyboard and mouse interaction
* CSS formatting for chosen mathemathical operators. I.e if if "+" is clicked, the background will be be blue until it is unselected or a calculation has been conducted. 
* The Calculator remembers the result, leading to fluid calculations rather than having to re-enter the result every time. 
* Support for 10 digits. The result is coded in such a way that the more integers you have, the less floats will be shown. The floats are also programmed to support up to 10 digits, but 1/2 will just be 0.5 and not 0.50000.....
